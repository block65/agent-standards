# Rust Engineering Standards

- **[Core & Style](rust/core.md)**: Verify cycles, lints, and safety.
- **[Error Handling](rust/errors.md)**: `anyhow` vs `thiserror`.
- **[Async & Concurrency](rust/concurrency.md)**: `tokio`, channels, and threading.
- **[Project & CI](rust/project.md)**: Dependencies, workspace, and testing.
- **[Observability](rust/observability.md)**: `tracing` and output discipline.
