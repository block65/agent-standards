# Rust Engineering Standards

This is the entry point for Rust-specific standards. Read the modules relevant to your current task:

- **[Core & Style](rust/core.md)**: Mandatory for all Rust work. Covers verify cycles, lints, and safety.
- **[Error Handling](rust/errors.md)**: Strategies for `anyhow` vs `thiserror`.
- **[Async & Concurrency](rust/concurrency.md)**: Read if working with `tokio`, channels, or multithreading.
- **[Project & CI](rust/project.md)**: Covers dependency management, workspace structure, and testing.
- **[Observability](rust/observability.md)**: Rules for `tracing` and CLI/Server output discipline.
