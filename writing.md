# Writing & Documentation Standards

Modular rules for writing. Use the base rules below for everything, then add a specific module if needed.

## 1. Base Rules (Use for everything)

### No Fluff & High Signal
- **Delete Adjectives:** Remove subjective or hyperbolic descriptors.
- **Fact-Based:** If a sentence works without the adjective, delete it.
- **No Unsubstantiated Claims:** Avoid bold assertions like "this is rarely done" or "industry standard" unless they are verifiable facts. If there is no evidence, do not state it.

### Write for Humans
- **Structure:** Avoid robotic or legalistic tones. Variegate sentence structures.
- **Cohesion:** Combine fragmented thoughts into cohesive paragraphs.

### Clarity & Formatting
- **Headings:** Must predict content.
- **Clarity:** Ensure clear antecedents for "it," "this," "that." No metaphors.

## 2. Specific Modules
- **[Technical Docs](writing/technical.md)**: Objectivity and clarity (No "Your").
- **[Marketing & Copy](writing/marketing.md)**: Persuasion and ownership (Yes "Your").

## 3. How to combine
To get the best results, load the files in this order:
- **For Docs:** `writing.md` -> `writing/technical.md`
- **For Marketing:** `writing.md` -> `writing/marketing.md`
