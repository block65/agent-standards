# Writing & Documentation Standards

Modular rules for writing. Use the base rules below for everything, then add a specific module if needed.

## 1. Base Rules (Use for everything)

### No Fluff
- **Delete Adjectives:** Remove subjective or hyperbolic descriptors.
- **Fact-Based:** If a sentence works without the adjective, delete it.
    - ❌ "The [Adjective] [Component] [Adverb] [Action]s [Data]."
    - ✅ "The [Component] [Action]s [Data] in [Metric]."

### Write for Humans
- **Structure:** Avoid robotic or legalistic tones. Variegate sentence structures.
- **Cohesion:** Combine fragmented thoughts into cohesive paragraphs.

### Clarity & Formatting
- **Headings:** Must predict content.
- **Clarity:** Ensure clear antecedents for "it," "this," "that." No metaphors.
