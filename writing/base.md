# Writing & Documentation Standards

Modular rules for writing. Use the base rules below for everything, then add a specific module if needed.

## 1. Base Rules (Use for everything)

### No Fluff & High Signal
- **Delete Adjectives:** Remove subjective or hyperbolic descriptors. If a sentence works without the adjective, delete it.
- **No Unsubstantiated Claims:** Avoid bold assertions like "this is rarely done" or "industry standard" unless they are verifiable facts. If there is no evidence, do not state it.

### Write for Humans
- **Structure:** Avoid robotic or legalistic tones. Vary sentence structure.
- **Cohesion:** Combine fragmented thoughts into cohesive paragraphs.
- **No Metaphors:** Do not use metaphors, analogies, or figurative language.

### Clarity & Formatting
- **Headings:** Must predict content.
- **Clarity:** Ensure clear antecedents for "it," "this," "that." Introduce a term before using a definite article to reference it.

### Prohibited Patterns
- **Filler Transitions:** Do not use "However,", "Furthermore,", "Moreover,", "Additionally,", "It's important to note that," "In today's world,".
- **Excessive Em-Dashes:** Do not use em-dashes as a crutch for sentence structure.
- **Unnecessary Lists:** Use prose when a list adds no structural value.

## 2. Specific Modules
