# Writing & Documentation Standards

Modular rules for writing. Use the base rules below for everything, then add a specific module if needed.

## 1. Base Rules (Use for everything)

### No Fluff
- **Delete Adjectives:** Remove "seamless," "cutting-edge," "powerful," "revolutionary."
- **Fact-Based:** If a sentence works without the adjective, delete it.
- **Write for Humans:** Avoid robotic or legalistic tones. Variegate sentence structures.

### Clarity & Formatting
- **Headings:** Must predict content; no self-links.
- **Clarity:** Ensure clear antecedents for "it," "this," "that." No metaphors.

## 2. Specific Modules
- **[Technical Docs](writing/technical.md)**: Focus on objectivity (No "Your").
- **[Marketing & Copy](writing/marketing.md)**: Focus on persuasion (Yes "Your").
- **[How to use](writing/how-to-use.md)**: How to combine these rules for different tasks.
