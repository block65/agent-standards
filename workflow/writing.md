# Writing & Documentation Standards

## General Principles
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless it's the industry standard.
- **Active Voice:** Write in the active voice to keep the copy engaging and direct.
- **Accessibility:** Use descriptive link text (no "click here"). Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.

## Marketing Copy
- **Benefits over Features:** Focus on how the product helps the user, not just what it does.
- **Punchy & Scannable:** Use short sentences, bullet points, and strong headers. Most users scan before they read.
- **Clear CTA:** Every marketing page must have a single, obvious call to action.

## Technical Documentation
- **Outcome-Oriented:** Start with the "what" and "why" before the "how."
- **Code-First:** For developer docs, provide a runnable or copy-pasteable code example for every concept.
- **Structured Hierarchy:** Use logical heading levels (H2, H3) to make the document search-friendly.
- **Consistency:** Use the same term for the same concept throughout the documentation.

## General Website Copy
- **User-Centric:** Use "you" and "your" more than "we" and "our."
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone and voice across all pages.
- **Truthful:** Avoid hyperbolic marketing fluff; stick to verifiable claims.
