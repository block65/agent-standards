# Dependency Trust

## Source Selection
- **Official first:** Prefer dependencies from established organisations or verified publishers over unknown individuals.
- **No blind installs:** Verify publisher, maintenance status, and repository activity before adding any dependency.
- **No trivial packages:** Do not add a dependency for functionality that is trivial to implement.
- **Current versions:** Use the latest stable release. Do not reference outdated or deprecated versions from training data.
